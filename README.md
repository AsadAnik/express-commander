## Changing the configurations as you like
By default it is creating `directories` at root level of your application. If you have `src` directory on your project then you can configure the setting to `express-commander` to behave like that. Also if you are developing your application with `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript` then you are also welcome, we have `TypeScript` supports for you and you can specifying which language you want to use by changing the configuration.

#### Using different directory on your project with different language,
Run this to make configuration with your directory or you want to use `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript`, you can specify which is your prepared things for your project, 
```bash 
npx express-commander config
```

#### Choosing `src` or not for perfect project structure,
