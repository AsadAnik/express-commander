# express-commander

# Development going on

## If you wants to contribute with development
1. Install first with `npm i` or `npm install`
2. Makefile is there only for test the application inside directory then if you wants to test with npm applicaiotn then not needs to use `Makefile` at that time, we will use `bin` commands then.
3. `npm start` will help you to build and play the commander then you can see which commands are avaible right now.
